# rich-markdown-editor

A React and [Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate) based editor that powers the [Outline wiki](http://getoutline.com) and can also be used for displaying content in a read-only fashion.
The editor is WYSIWYG and includes many formatting tools whilst retaining the ability to write markdown
shortcuts inline and output Markdown.


## Usage

```javascript
import Editor from "rich-markdown-editor";

<Editor
  defaultValue="Hello world!"
/>
```

See a working example in the [example directory](/example).


### Props

#### `defaultValue`

A markdown string that represents the initial value of the editor. Use this to prop to restore
previously saved content for the user to continue editing.

#### `placeholder`

Allows overriding of the placeholder text displayed in the main body content. The default is "Write something nice…".

#### `readOnly`

With `readOnly` set to `false` the editor is optimized for composition. When `true` the editor can be used to display previously written content – headings gain anchors, a table of contents displays and links become clickable.

#### `autoFocus`

When set `true` together with `readOnly` set to `false`, focus at the
document automatically.

#### `toc`

With `toc` set to `true` the editor will display a table of contents for headings in the document. This is particularly useful for larger documents and allows quick jumping to key sections.

#### `plugins`

Allows additional [Slate plugins](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/blob/master/docs/general/plugins.md) to be passed to the underlying Slate editor.

#### `schema`

Allows additional Slate schema to be passed to the underlying Slate editor.

#### `theme`

Allows overriding the inbuilt theme to brand the editor, for example use your own font face and brand colors to have the editor fit within your application. See the [inbuilt theme](/src/theme.js) for an example of the keys that should be provided.

#### `dark`

With `dark` set to `true` the editor will use a default dark theme that's included. See the [source here](/src/theme.js).


### Callbacks

#### `uploadImage`

If you want the editor to support images then this callback must be provided. The callback should accept a single `File` object and return a promise the resolves to a url when the image has been uploaded to a storage location, for example S3. eg:

```javascript
<Editor
  uploadImage={async file => {
    const result = await s3.upload(file);
    return result.url;
  }}
/>
```

#### `onSave({ done: boolean })`

This callback is triggered when the user explicitly requests to save using a keyboard shortcut, `Cmd+S` or `Cmd+Enter`. You can use this as a signal to save the document to a remote server.

#### `onCancel`

This callback is triggered when the `Cmd+Escape` is hit within the editor. You may use it to cancel editing.

#### `onChange(() => value)`

This callback is triggered when the contents of the editor changes, usually due to user input such as a keystroke or using formatting options. You may use this to locally persist the editors state, see the [inbuilt example](/example/index.js).

As of `v4.0.0` this callback returns a function which when called returns the current text value of the document. This optimization is made to avoid serializing the state of the document to text on every change event, allowing the host app to choose when it needs this value.

#### `onImageUploadStart`

This callback is triggered before `uploadImage` and can be used to show some UI that indicates an upload is in progress.

#### `onImageUploadStop`

Triggered once an image upload has succeeded or failed.

#### `onSearchLink(term: string)`

The editor provides an ability to search for links to insert from the formatting toolbar. If this callback is provided it should accept a search term as the only parameter and return a promise that resolves to an array of [SearchResult](/src/types.js) objects. eg:

#### `onShowToast(message: string)`

Triggered when the editor wishes to show a toast message to the user. Hook into your apps
notification system, or simplisticly use `window.alert(message)`.



```javascript
<Editor
  onSearchLink={async searchTerm => {
    const results = await MyAPI.search(searchTerm);

    return results.map(result => {
      title: result.name,
      url: result.url
    })
  }}
/>
```

#### `onClickLink(href: string)`

This callback allows overriding of link handling. It's often the case that you want to have external links open a new window whilst internal links may use something like `react-router` to navigate. If no callback is provided then default behavior will apply to all links. eg:


```javascript
import { history } from "react-router";

<Editor
  onClickLink={href => {
    if (isInternalLink(href)) {
      history.push(href);
    } else {
      window.location.href = href;
    }
  }}
/>
```

#### `renderNode`

This callback allows overriding of the [inbuilt renderNode](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor/blob/master/src/nodes.js) – if a component is returned from the callback then it will be used instead of the default implementation. See the [Slate documentation](https://docs.slatejs.org/guides/rendering#nodes-and-marks) for an example.

#### `renderPlaceholder`

This callback allows overriding of the [inbuilt renderPlaceholder](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor/blob/master/src/index.js) – if a callback is provided then it will be used instead of the default implementation. See the [Slate documentation](https://docs.slatejs.org/guides/rendering#placeholders) for an example.
